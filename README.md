### Code long and prosper ðŸ––

I am a passionate software engineer specialized in microservices environments. I enjoy designing and building backend systems and APIs for other enginneers to build on.

I am currently involved in the re-design of Inditex's e-commerce as a microservices solution as a member of the e-commerce architecture team. This position has given me the opportunity (_and the challenge, at the same time!_) of balancing my time between the three aspects of software engineering I enjoy the most: learning, mentoring and tackling complex problems.

Learning and mentoring are an intrinsic part of software development to me. We _should_ always be engaged in both activities to the best of our abilities as part of our daily duties (_even if it's not among your strengths, that's ok!_). That belief makes me a strong advocate of healthy collaborative environments where every opinion can be voiced and people should always be treated with kindness.

### Disclaimer

As my greeting my have already hinted, I enjoy science fiction and high fantasy. Whatever you can think of on those topics, I can probably rant about. _Be warned, there be dragons (and so many other things)!_
