### Live long and prosper ðŸ––

I am a passionate software engineer specialized in microservices environments. I enjoy designing and building backend systems and APIs for other enginneers to build on.

### What pikes my interest?

I am currently focusing on learning technologies I find interesting, whether they are part of my day to day toolkit or not. My aims are currently on improving my knowledge on the following technologies, both from a developer's and an operator's perspective:

* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)! You never know enough of it nowadays.
* [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka)! When I got introduced to Kafka some time ago, I found its highly configurable approach to produce very different producer and consumer scenarios interesting. The interest hasn't worn off, even if I some times wish there were a few configurations _less_ to get wrong.
* [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra)! I missed the initial hype train on this one, because my interests were elsewhere at the time. Since then, reading on its architecture, its overall design got my attention.
* [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)! I have always found myself working hand to hand with SRE teams because of my passion for systems design. Open Telemetry feels like an amazing opportunity to lay common foundations on how we observe running systems, and that's a party I don't want to miss.

This list is by no means everything I like to keep up to date on, just where I am trying to focus my learning efforts.

### About me and my profession

Over the years, I have come to the realization that the two things I enjoy the most of my job are learning and teaching. I love a challenge as much as any backend engineer, and that moment of triumph when you manage to decompose a complex problem into simpler components, _and they just make sense_; but they are both a path to either learning or helping others learn.

Another thing I have learned, is that I _really_ like to sleep at night. On-call rotations taught me that building simple and on solid foundations, means I get paged less frequently; trying out new things and learning is fantastic, but, in my opinion, mission critical should always follow the _"Will it let me sleep at night?"_ approach.

### Just about me

As my greeting my have already hinted, I enjoy science fiction and high fantasy. Whatever you can think of on those topics, I can probably rant about. _Be warned, there be dragons (and so many other things)!_
